# Admin Setup Instructions for PeerRent

## How to Create the First Admin User

Since the admin system is now implemented, you need to manually create the first admin user for security reasons.

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Register a Normal Account**
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000/register`
   - Create a user account with your desired email and PIN
   - Complete the registration process

2. **Connect to Your MongoDB Database**
   - Option A: Use MongoDB Compass (recommended for GUI)
   - Option B: Use MongoDB command line interface
   - Option C: Use any MongoDB management tool

3. **Find Your User Document**
   - Navigate to your database (likely named `peerrent` or similar)
   - Open the `users` collection
   - Find the document with your email address

4. **Update the Role Field**
   - Locate the `role` field in your user document
   - Change the value from `"user"` to `"admin"`
   - Save the document

5. **Verify Admin Access**
   - Log out and log back in to the website
   - You should now see a red "Admin Dashboard" link in the navigation
   - Click it to access `/admin` and verify your admin privileges

### Example MongoDB Compass Steps:
1. Open MongoDB Compass
2. Connect to your local MongoDB instance
3. Navigate to your database â†’ users collection
4. Find your user document
5. Click the edit button (pencil icon)
6. Change `"role": "user"` to `"role": "admin"`
7. Click the checkmark to save

### Example Command Line Steps:
```bash
# Connect to MongoDB
mongo

# Switch to your database
use peerrent

# Find your user
db.users.find({email: "your-email@example.com"})

# Update the role
db.users.updateOne(
  {email: "your-email@example.com"},
  {$set: {role: "admin"}}
)
```

### Security Notes:
- Only trusted individuals should be given admin privileges
- Admin users have access to delete any items and view all platform data
- The first admin must always be created manually for security
- Additional admins can be created through the admin dashboard once implemented

### Current Admin Features:
- âœ… Platform statistics (user count, item count)
- âœ… Role-based access control
- âœ… Admin-only navigation link
- âœ… Secure middleware protection
- ðŸš§ User management (planned)
- ðŸš§ Item moderation (planned)
- ðŸš§ Advanced reporting (planned)

Once you have admin access, you can help develop and test additional admin features!
