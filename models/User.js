/**
 * USER MODEL
 * Database schema for user accounts in the PeerRent platform
 * 
 * This model supports the Hybrid OTP Authentication System:
 * - Users set a 4-digit PIN (stored as hashedSecret)
 * - System generates 4-digit email code (stored as otp)
 * - Users combine both to create 8-digit login key
 * 
 * Authentication Flow:
 * 1. User registers with email + 4-digit PIN
 * 2. User requests login code â†’ system sends 4-digit OTP via email
 * 3. User enters PIN + OTP = 8-digit key to login
 * 4. System verifies and issues JWT token stored in cookies

  // Originally designed for role-based admin system

/**
 * IMPORTANT NOTES:
 * 
 * Security Features:
 * - PIN is hashed with bcrypt (never stored in plain text)
 * - OTP expires after short time window
 * - Email serves as username (no separate username needed)
 * 
 * Authentication Integration:
 * - Works with JWT tokens for session management
 * - Integrates with cookie-based authentication
 * - Supports password-less login system
 * 
 * Admin System:
 * - Role field exists but current admin system uses session-based auth
 * - Admin credentials stored separately in config/adminConfig.js
